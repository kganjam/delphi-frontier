"""Assemble artifacts/reuse-study-visuals/manifest.json: the voxel render plus the two native epithelial movies.

The voxel entry is built by render_voxel.manifest(). The epithelial entry only HASHES and reads producer files (09's committed
artifacts/epithelial/); it renders nothing and runs no physics. Every number it quotes is read from results-r2.json here.
