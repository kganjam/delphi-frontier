"""The resolved local fin-patch case for the v3a leading-edge ray, and its transfer to the contract.

Why a patch: the global 3D CFD (cfd3d v1) carries the 0.10 mm membrane as a 3.7-cell shell at
h = 1.8-7.2 mm, so its fin jumps are smeared and refused. A load on ray 0 needs the pressure on both
faces of a member that the grid actually resolves. The patch is a set of chordwise sections through
ray 0 at the contract's station positions, each resolved to >= 4 cells across the membrane, in
which the membrane, and optionally the ray-0 rod at the leading edge, is a real solid.

What it is not: a 2D section is a strip, so the records it yields are `2d-extrusion` and the
contract refuses them for any `whole_fin_3d` target. The finite-span effect enters only through the
declared alpha_eff (lifting line, assumed). The frozen protocol says so, and the gates do not change
after a result is seen.

Resolution is computed here from the producer's own h_m and thickness_m and never copied from a
producer's claim. EI and the ray section stay UNKNOWN: this module transfers loads, never deflections.
