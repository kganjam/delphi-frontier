"""Lean evidence gallery: the real Lean source, the exact receipts of the runs that compiled it, and the mutants Lean rejected.

build(ins, out) returns the snapshot object and writes the published files into `out` under the site's "@artifacts/lean-gallery/..." convention.

were compiled and compares them with the receipt. A family whose files have changed since its receipt is reported as stale or refused, never as
compiled, and its source is not published. What Lean checked is only the stated mathematics; it says nothing about organism viability,
a genotype-to-fin causal link or any empirical fact."""
