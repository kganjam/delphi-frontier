"""Build the two reuse-study proposals as validated Project drafts, plus one import bundle.

Authoritative text lives in site/content/projects.json (entries with template "reuse-study"); this script derives the Project
payloads from it, so the page and the draft cannot drift. Member refs are copied verbatim from site/data/catalog.json and the
script fails closed if one is absent. No source or evidence ref is invented: the papers behind each study have no record in the
catalog, so they appear as the page's sources and in `source`, not as members.

    python3 scripts/build_extra_projects.py [--created-at ISO8601]

Writes projects/<id>.draft.json for each study and projects/extra-projects.bundle.json (frontier-bundle-0.1, Project records
only, namespace "snapshot"; re-pin with build_flying_fish_project.repin before submitting to a live node). The bundle is
PREPARED ONLY: nothing here imports, reviews or accepts it.
